// MyProjects store — user-authored AI projects added via the "我的AI项目"
// page. **Two-table architecture** (mirrors Model Nexus):
//
//   • Built-in entries (Reversi / AI Translator) live in code + the bundled
//     resource dir. They are NOT stored here — the page computes them at
//     render time, and the only persistence they need is the reference copy
//     in ~/.echobird/<id>/ (which Rust's seed_builtin_to_user_dir manages).
//     They render alongside user entries but can't be edited or deleted —
//     they're system data, like the built-in models in Model Nexus.
//
//   • User-added entries live here, persisted to localStorage. CRUD as
//     expected.
//
// On init() we run a one-time migration that strips any entry with
// linkedToolId set — those were seeded by the previous architecture and
// don't belong in user storage anymore.
